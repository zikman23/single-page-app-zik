## Hollywood Classic Films

![screenshot](/images/screenshot.png)

## Overview

I tried to refactor the Hollywood classic films coding exercise, which involved same page routing. I tried to combine it with the bootstrap navbar exercise, and change the entire layout from what it started with. The product, about, and checkout pages would be broken out into separate pages that would load in the same page upon clicking links or buttons. Unfortunately, I got a bit carried away working with Bootstrap, so it is unfinished currently. But I plan to polish it up and I think it will be a good exercise to sum up this weeks work.
